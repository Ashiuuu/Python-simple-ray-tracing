# Python-simple-ray-tracing
Personnal exercise writing a simple python ray tracing 3d renderer

The renderer for now just handles spheres, diffuse lighting, specular lighting, and color materials.
TODO : radiosity, transparent materials, triangles, planes and object files.
Might also add explanations.
